        comment: 'A true seeker attended one of my talks in Sedona and called me with his 83 year old father who had 12 malignancies in the prostate area. I performed one session on the father wed night through talking with the son for the session. I was impressed how he knew so much about his fatherâ€™s life. The father laid next to a Tesla energy device with scalar frequencies during the session, which helped lift the vibrations of the father and hold him to a higher vibration while I accomplished the healing session. On Friday he went to a scan, which I suggested, and was found to be clear of the 12 malignancies. A kernel of the problem was left in the prostate which was readily cleared in the next session. God is Gracious!!!',
